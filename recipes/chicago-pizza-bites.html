        <!--Ingredients section-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>16 ounce package of cold, prepared pizza dough</li>
            <li>4 ounces provolone cheese, diced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cooked, crumbled Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooked, diced sweet peppers</li>
            <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <!--Instructions section-->
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease a standard muffin pan with 2 teaspoons of oil.</li>
            <li>Roll dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Cut the dough into 4-inch circles, rerolling dough if necessary. (<strong>Tip:</strong> rolling dough onto a floured surface helps prevent stickiness.)</li>
            <li>Place each circle of dough into the oiled muffin cup neatly into the center with edges gently pressed to the sides of the cup</li>
            <li>Put a tablespoon of provolone cheese, followed by a tablespoon of cooked sausage and two teaspoons of cooked peppers. Lightly compress the toppings inward to free space for 1 tablespoon of mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons of pizza sauce. Press toppings one more time and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, aiming for golden brown crust and deliciously melty toppings.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from the oven and provide 10-15 minutes for the pizzas to cool while in the tray. Remove each pizza by using a knife along the edge to separate each one from its cup and then using a fork to lift it out.</li>
            <li>Allow pizzas to cool on a rack for a few minutes before plating. (<strong>Tip:</strong> garnish pizzas with a dusting of parsley for added style!)</li>
        </ol>
